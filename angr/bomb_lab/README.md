# Bomb Lab

skeleton.py needs filling in - bomb.h gives you a nice indication of what each function expects ;)

View the dissassembly of each function using `objdump -d`, note the 'kaboom' and 'phase_defused' functions, they give you your find and avoid addresses. You just need to work out a start address and how to work with the arguments and get them back in a readable format.
