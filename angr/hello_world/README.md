# Hello World!

This is a simple introduction to using Angr's API and symbolic execution capabilities, this will mostly be a walk through with a small exercise in 'generate_serial_skeleton.py'. The 'serial' library supports four simple validation routines for provided serial codes and I'll shown how to make good use of Angr to solve them efficiently and cleanly.
